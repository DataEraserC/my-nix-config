# My nix configurations

- This is my Nix configuration file. The goal is to unify the configurations of all devices (Darwin/NixOS/Linux/Nix-on-Droid) and organize them uniformly in a single repository using Nix.

> At present, it is still in the early stage, with only 'nix-on-droid' stored.
> This repo will not include nix derivations (may be in the future will) since I don't know how to merge [it](https://github.com/Program-Learning/nur-packages) in my config.

- you can navigate to [Structure](./docs/struct.txt) for the directory structure.
